In the repository for this chapter I include two notebooks:
1. the updated notebook for extracting the post offices for POst Office Ltd website.
2. the notebook for calculating the isochrones and their population based on OA population.
For this notebook to run one needs:
- an API key from openrouteservice.org (free)
- points of service (Location - Lat& Long and Capacity - opening hours)
- PWC (population weighted centroids) of OAs
