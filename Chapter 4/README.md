# Chapter 4 - Exploratory spatial data analysis

This chapter was based on Sonea, A., Guo, W., & Jarvis, S. (2019). Exploratory spatial analysis of access to physical and digital retail banking channels. Tech rep., Think Forward Initiative, Amsterdam.

The original repository for this report is: https://github.com/andrasonea/TFI_AccessToBanking

Here I include an updated example for extracting the bank branches using the Branch Location Open Banking API.
